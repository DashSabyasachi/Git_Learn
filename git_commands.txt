one by one all command practice:
..................................
git init(initialize a git repo)
git add .
git commit -m "version name"
git branch -m main
git remote origin repo_link
git push -u origin main
Then for another branch as sabya
git branch -m sabya (sabya branch created)
git status
git add fileA.py
git commit -m "push1 from sabya"
git push -u origin sabya(fileA.py pushed from sabya branch)
now i will merge the sabya branch with mainbranch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge sabya
git push origin main

for cloning:         git clone repo_path(ssh/https)
for pull a clone folder:       git pull origin main



process of remove merge conflict:  1st conflict happen on that time when we commited same file from 2 or more branches at the same time then git was unable to know which change it will keep or which not. so merge conflict happen.
then if we got to konow from which file conflict happen and then locally we visit this file remove <<<<<  ====   >>>>> symbols and save it again.
then execute in CLI some commands
git add .
git commit -m "version_name"
git push origin branch_name




git cherry-pick:  this command is used for move a specific file from one branch to another. 
git cherry-pick commitHash
git push origin main



git log : used for see the commit history for any branch.
git log main
git log sabya
git log main --oneline
git log --oneline --graph



git diff: used for see the difference between the branch, commit(by commitHash) but if there is no difference it will not show anything.
git diff main sabya
git diff 60w4586 78q5241


git rebase: It is used for move branch commit on top of another branch to cleaner linear history. we only do rebasing for feature branch not shared branch.git rebase update file based on commit history.

git checkout featureBranch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push origin featureBranch --force-with-lease
